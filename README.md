# picoCTF 2024

## Overview ##

I participated in the [picoCTF](www.picoctf.org) 2024 competition as an individual competing in the Global category, organised by [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu/), which ran from Mar TODO 2023 to Mar TODO 2024. 

This is a write up of the challenges solved during the event.

**This event write up is a work in progress.**

As time permits I'll be adding further individual challenge write ups for all those marked as `(Solved)`, based on my notes taken during the event. Additionally there may be the odd challenge that I failed to solve but want to document my progress, marked `(Unsolved - Progress Writeup)`.
