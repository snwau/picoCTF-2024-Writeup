# picoCTF 2024

## Overview ##

I participated in the [picoCTF](www.picoctf.org) 2024 competition as an individual competing in the Global category, organised by [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu/), which ran from 13'th to 27'th March 2024 (local time). 

This is a write up of the challenges solved during the event.

## Pull Requests ##

As the purpose of this repository is to document my personl progress and write up my approach and solutions, which may be of help to others, it doesn't make a lot of sense to accept pull requests for solutions I didn't solve. I welcome comments or better solutions to solve the challenges documented, but otherwise I recommend creating a similar repository of your own.
