## Description ##

Do you know how to use the web inspector?
Start searching here to find the flag

## Approach ##

Opening the supplied link and opening the web inspector, the sources for each page were examined for anything that may resemble a flag or flag in obfuscated form.

Navigating through the webpage navigation bar containing "Home", "About" and "Contact" the following was found within the source for `about.html`:

    ...
    <section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9">
     <h1>
      Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there
     </h1>
     <!-- .about-container -->
    </section>
    ...

The value for `notify_true` looks suspiciously like an encoded string.

## Solution ##

Decoding using base64, decodes the flag :

    $ echo "cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMjgzZTYyZmV9" | base64 -d
    picoCTF{...........redacted.............}

Where the actual flag value has been redacted for the purposes of this write up.
